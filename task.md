## Task Description:
You have been tasked with building a simple web application that allows users to manage their tasks. The application should allow users to create, update, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed.

## Technical Requirements:
1. Use the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js) stack to build the web application.
2. Use MongoDB as the database to store task information.
3. Use Express.js to handle HTTP requests and responses.
4. Use Angular to build the user interface for the website.
5. Use Node.js to handle server-side logic and communicate with the database.
6. Implement authentication and authorization features for users to create accounts and login.
7. Implement a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for tasks.
8. Implement a feature that allows users to mark tasks as completed and view their completed tasks separately.
9. Use Git for version control.

## Expected Deliverables:
1. A fully functional web application that meets the technical requirements mentioned above.
2. Codebase hosted on a Git repository with clear documentation and instructions on how to run the application.

## Evaluation Criteria:
1. Quality of code and adherence to best practices.
2. User experience and functionality of the web application.
3. Technical competency and ability to use the MEAN stack effectively.

## Ground rules
1. The solution should be coded in TypeScript or JavaScript. Styling should be done in CSS or SCSS. Your choice.
2. Put the code on your GitHub account in a public repo.
3. You don't need to add any extra features or improvements not listed in the Acceptance Criteria. There are no bonus points for it.
4. You can use other external libraries to speed up your work.
5. You can use a styling framework (Material UI, Bootstrap, or other) for quick and consistent styling.
6. If you're not able to implement all parts of the task, partial submissions are welcome.

## Tips
* Simplicity is highly valued in this exercise.
